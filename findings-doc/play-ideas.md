# Portuguese Playtest Scratch Pad

Persistent route ideas for the playtester. Mark each route with evidence in
`play-log.md` after completing it; promote only confirmed defects to
`findings.md`.

## Current residuals to verify after fixes

- Date formatting: reach January-to-February rollover and inspect every date
  header, event line, and newspaper date.
- Squad naming: inspect the default squad name in base, roster, assets, and
  character profile at the 80-column console width.
- Character profile: inspect profession, education, body-part labels, wounds,
  weapons, armor, and health-state vocabulary.
- Footer and wrapping: revisit review-assets and founder biography with the
  longest Portuguese labels and capture the final row of each screen.

## Broader unexplored routes

- Travel to each available city and inspect destination names, travel prompts,
  and site descriptions.
- Visit every shop category, including clothing, equipment, tools, firearms,
  and pawn-shop status flows.
- Recruit conservatives through dialogue; inspect pronouns, names, persuasion
  prompts, success/failure text, and continuation controls.
- Trigger combat and surrender/arrest paths; inspect action legends, injuries,
  body parts, weapon effects, and post-fight summaries.
- Explore police, court, prison, hospital, and safe-house site actions.
- Advance through several month-end cycles to cover legislative results,
  funding, finance, media, and random newspaper events.
- Exercise save export/import and corrupted-save handling in Portuguese.
- Repeat key screens at a narrow viewport to expose width assumptions.

## Runtime acceleration

`lib/title_screen/title_screen.dart` exposes `megaFounderCheat`, and
`lib/title_screen/new_game.dart` checks it during founder creation. If a route
needs acceleration, enable the flag temporarily in a local playtest build,
record the altered build in `play-log.md`, and do not commit the cheat change.

## Exit condition

Do not mark the localization goal complete until a fresh Portuguese replay
covers the high-risk routes above, every confirmed issue is fixed or explicitly
accepted, focused and full tests pass, and the findings tracker has no open
translation or layout issues backed by current evidence.
