Observed:

Observed:

- English headers, statuses, equipment, and activity names remained throughout
  core management screens.

  `QQualquer outra tecla`.

### Options, changelog, and saves

1. Returned to the title screen.
2. Reviewed gameplay, interface, and content options.
3. Opened the changelog.

Observed:

- Gameplay-option labels were largely localized.
- Interface/content labels were Portuguese while their explanatory text
  remained English.
- The changelog was wholly English.
- Save management mixed both languages, duplicated back navigation, clipped
  the Portuguese prompt, and merged adjacent row columns.

3. Reviewed the main store menu, firearms, Liberal tools, and equipment.
4. Returned to base and selected Downtown Seattle.
5. Reviewed downtown destinations.

- [`screenshots/39-police-station-action.png`](screenshots/39-police-station-action.png)

Observed:

- Generic destination names and store inventory remained English.
- Generated business names exposed word-by-word translation failures.
- The purchase flow was almost entirely English.
- The site-action controls were translated, but their legend overflowed the
  console and the surrounding status headers remained English.

### Follow-up pass: introduction, newspaper, and month end

1. Launched a detached clean worktree at commit
   `672e5c760a75416a5c4ba00b2fc4450473fa2f35`.
2. Generated required JSON serialization files and verified the baseline with
   the full Flutter test suite (317 tests passed).
3. Started a fresh Portuguese campaign and completed all ten founder questions
   with individually paced key input.
4. Reviewed the conservative-era introduction.
5. Waited through January, reviewed a daily newspaper, and advanced into the
   month-end Congress and finance sequence.

Evidence:

- [`screenshots/41-newspaper-mixed-language.png`](screenshots/41-newspaper-mixed-language.png)

- [`screenshots/44-monthly-finance-mixed-language.png`](screenshots/44-monthly-finance-mixed-language.png)

Observed:

- Long Portuguese introduction lines were clipped, and
  `extrema-direita Arqui Conservadora` did not preserve the requested
  capitalization/form.
- The newspaper combined a Portuguese headline with an English subheadline,
  masthead, and subscription copy; its top navigation also clipped.
- Month-end legislative notices and institutional headers remained English.
- The monthly finance report localized its frame but not its asset categories.

### Replay pass: settled shared localization tree

This pass intentionally tested the live shared working tree rather than a
clean commit.

- Initial server checkpoint: 2026-07-19 15:29:38 -03:00
- Rebuilt after the other localization agents settled: approximately
  2026-07-19 15:54 -03:00
- Exact source checkpoint recorded: 2026-07-19 16:01:23 -03:00
- Branch: `feature/localization`
- HEAD: `672e5c760a75416a5c4ba00b2fc4450473fa2f35`
- Dirty source state excluding `findings-doc/**`: 94 tracked paths and 12
  untracked paths
- Tracked source diff SHA-256:
  `47a5dc9e0cff433b2d3d26aba61208bdb74fcbc0fe6e912041f046b1ce383043`
- Untracked source-path SHA-256:
  `276b3e3b900bba5eac26a7948f2c2645605289bdcbac52b78a3200f070e02a4d`

  `3f0e1d2e4a87c393fa1814bdfff91641b8d90f3209414058e2238fb6a02bc8e7`
- Browser: isolated agent-browser Chrome-for-Testing session
- Viewport: 1527 × 1293

Explored:

1. Replayed the Portuguese title, gameplay/interface/content settings, new-game
   configuration, founder biography, and conservative-era introduction.
2. Created an autosave and opened the real save-management table.
3. Continued the campaign through base and squad equipment.
4. Travelled to shopping, entered the pawn shop, and reviewed firearms, tools,
   and equipment after rebuilding the server from the settled tree.
5. Waited through 5 January and opened the media overview.
6. Attempted to render the next major-event newspaper.

Resolved by replay:

- PT-001, PT-002, and PT-003 on the Portuguese title.
- PT-005 on the replayed base/equipment vocabulary surfaces.
- PT-007 with an actual save row.
- PT-008 across all three settings groups.
- PT-010 across the pawn-shop transaction paths.
- PT-014 with the exact phrase
  `extrema-direita Arqui Conservadora`.

Open at the initial capture (before the fixes below):

- PT-004 was open at capture: `Clothes` and clipped founder answers persisted.
- PT-015 could not be cleared because the newspaper path crashes.
- PT-018: `Mais difícil` clips beyond the new-game console border.
- PT-019: transport metadata renders the malformed `(Sportção)`.
- PT-020: a pawn-shop status action clips at the right edge.
- PT-021: the media overview retains English chrome.
- PT-022: the major-event newspaper crashes with a negative index.

All PT-001 through PT-024 findings are resolved in the current tree; the list
above is retained as the historical pre-fix replay record.

## Post-fix verification pass

The crash and layout findings were then converted into regression tests and
minimal fixes on the shared tree:

- PT-004: biography options now wrap within the 80-column console; clothing
  metadata and transport names use locale-aware rendering. Fresh replay
  confirms the long answers remain visible.
- PT-006: base controls and management tables now use explicit fitted cells,
  keeping Portuguese actions, health, location, and activity columns apart.
- PT-011: continuation prompts use the localized option renderer and wrapped
  action legends, so key prefixes are not duplicated or clipped.
- PT-018: difficulty legend placement is bounded by the fixed console width.
- PT-019: XML vehicle short name `Sport` now renders as `Esportivo` instead of
  the malformed `Sportção`.
- PT-020: pawn-shop status actions occupy separate full-width rows.
- PT-021: media-overview title, headers, footer, and guidance are covered by
  Portuguese catalog entries.
- PT-015: Herald masthead, navigation, subscription copy, and the pollution
  subheadline are covered by the Portuguese newspaper regression suite.
- PT-022: newspaper glyph drawing is bounds-safe, chooses a compact font, and
  clips any remaining over-wide translated headline before centering; the
  former negative-index failure is covered by direct, full major-event, and
  very-long-headline tests.
- PT-023: the gun-control story now translates `mass shooting`, `university`,
  and the shooter pronoun (`ele` rather than raw `he`).
- PT-024: the squad table now fits long founder names to the fixed name column;
  screenshot 82 captures the pre-fix collision and the regression test protects
  the skill column.
- PT-009: generated commerce names now use Portuguese phrase-level templates;
  the pawn-shop descriptor is `Casa de penhores e armas`, while the insurance
  and latte-stand templates preserve Portuguese word order.
- PT-012: title and identity prompts use Brazilian Portuguese sentence case and
  idiomatic wording.
- PT-013: the changelog overlay localizes its chrome and labels historical
  English-only notes explicitly; it also fits the available viewport.

Fresh replay evidence also confirms the character-creation spacing and wrapping
fixes in screenshots 78–80.

Focused localization/layout/newspaper tests and the full Flutter suite pass.
Catalog canonicalization, prefix validation, strict interpolation auditing,
the extractor, analyzer, and whitespace checks also pass.

## Not covered

- Combat with an encountered enemy
- Recruitment dialogue through successful completion
- Save import/export
- Other cities and viewport sizes

These remain useful targets for a follow-up runtime pass.
