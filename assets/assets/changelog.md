* Fixed adults being treated as middle aged and having small stat shifts as a result

## 1.3.0 - 5/1/2025
* Major mechanical rebalance to use 2d6 instead of 1d20 rolls, and skill checks no longer add the relevant attribute score making actual skill value much more important than before. Feedback on this is very welcome as it touches almost everything in the game, but in general it should make it harder to do some things at low skill levels, and easier to do them consistently at high skill levels.
* Major hostage tending overhaul, the LCS can no longer beat or torture hostages, but will now engage in cultish love bombing tactics to try to seduce imprisoned Conservatives into changing their worldview. You can now send ransom notes and release hostages. You can only get sleeper agents by releasing hostages and having them volunteer to help you afterwards. You can only recruit someone by selecting an option to recruit them, instead of as a side effect of doing well at persuasion. Police hunt kidnapped people less aggressively, unless you send a ransom note, which generates a lot of heat.
* Crime heat rebalance; most crimes reduced in heat value
* New Media Overview & Influence screen, giving a history of news stories and their impact on public opinion

* If the US President is a sleeper agent, they will work to overhaul their cabinet if set to expand sleeper network

* Made bank tellers ID robbers to the police
* Made landlords less brave and less trustworthy

* You can now kidnap enemies that would drop their weapon and flee anyway

* Updated the liberal agenda screen with better feedback about public interest levels and new flavor text for LCS approval ("consider the LCS a force for good") and CCS disapproval ("want the CCS brought to justice")
* Increased the effect of public interest on public opinion shifts
* CCS won't hunt you if they don't have a safehouse in the same city, unless they get very strong
* CCS won't hunt you until you've appeared in the papers
* Background public opinion shifts can now affect LCS and CCS popularity
* Liberal Judges can now be useful sleeper agents

* Overhauled heat of all kinds and siege logic; offendable entities will now hunt and siege sites even when visible heat doesn't exceed secrecy based on the presence of people who offended them, though secrecy and heat are still factors in their ability to find those people
* Nerfed Police Gang Units and Death Squads somewhat by giving them weaker weapons, and made regular cops never carry MP5s even at C+ gun control
* Added .45 handguns to the possible weapon pool used by Agents and Gang Members
* Added a tip in the medical task menu about passive healing
* Fixed accuracy of the skill list for teaching combat
* Allowed wrapping around the liberal agenda page list
* More severe consequences for carrying out certain traumatic actions
* Made it so you capture all remaining CCS safehouses if you wipe them out and they still have any left
* Made it harder to recover from severe heart damage (eg, in interrogation)
* Made neo-nazis and nazi punks basically never flee so you aren't forced to let them go
* Added knowledge skills (business, law, religion, science) to writing/streaming like the info text says, so if you have well educated writers they'll be much more effective
* Fixed an oversight where the sci-fi easter egg at year 2100 was omitted
* Fixed the CCS storyline advancing too fast
* Fixed up some bugs with the questions giving clothing incorrectly
* Gave you streetwear in place of your normal clothes if you have a gang member start and no other replacement clothing (intentionally omitted by the mechanics text due to very low importance)
* Fixed judges and non-union workers losing their names when converted by enlightenment
* Made conservatized police negotiators revert to being police officers
* Fixed being able to keep your car even after being run off the road in a car chase
* Added flavor text for what's in the display case before you smash it

* Made the news report on converting people with music and made news stories gain priority for it
* Made it so you always get juice for killing enemies even if their injuries after they're dead would have caused them to wish they'd run away

* When police make something up to charge someone with, the prosecution will be much weaker
* Adjusted the flavor text and grammar during trials to make the grammatical tense more consistent
* Gave 25 juice to the sleeper lawyer if they succeed in getting the defendant acquitted; self-defense gives this juice to the defendant if it succeeds
* Doubled the influence of skill on defense quality to buff all defense options besides Elite Liberal Attorney Astraea Justice or whatever (which is still incredibly strong)
* Fixed a bug where you could reassign someone doing a location-specific task (streaming) to a location where that task isn't possible and they'd just keep doing it
* Fixed two unintended cases where you could potentially get your "naked" clothing item soaked in blood and need to wash it
* Fixed cases where you could alienate someone and not have them take on the conservative rename they were supposed to (like "Jaded Liberal Judge" or "Ex-Union Worker")
* Fixed the option at character creation that gives downtown maps not giving the correct maps
* Fixed dating and talking about the person's work location not actually giving you maps of the location
* Simplified the graffiti symbols for the LCS and CCS to work around a bug with rendering the map with the old symbols
* Revised disguise logic so that you need to pass checks in a few more situations, and you get experience even when disguise if you walk past a conservative in a secure location even if a check isn't rolled
* Revised the flavor text for a couple security rejections related to damaged and second rate clothing
* Finally found and fixed a longstanding bug with squad management that shows up in a lot of exotic ways, where pressing 9 to dissolve a squad as you're forming it could cause all sorts of strange bugs due to the person thinking they're not in the squad but the squad thinking the person is in it
* Made it so cancelling adding someone while forming a squad will return them to their previous squad rather than making them squadless, if relevant

## 1.2.7 - 4/6/2025

* Updated the language shown on the criminal record screen to make it more clear that "Sentenced to..." refers to the person having escaped from an incomplete prison sentence
* Added potential unlawful speech and terrorism charges to media takeovers
* Made media takeovers always affect free speech issue, and also affect gun control if any squad member is carrying a legal firearm
* Fixed a bug where sweatshop workers were wearing cheap suits and dresses
* Cleaned up feedback about hitting armor a bit so it doesn't say stuff like "hit Hard Armor Vest, Helmet, Extras"
* Made enemies capable of threatening you braver in general, but lose their bonus courage as they get hurt
* Renamed "too much armor" to "homemade tank suit"
* Slightly buffed court appointed attorney
* Revised self-defense to use similar math to being your own lawyer, but slightly worse and you can bungle it hard if you have low law skill

* Fixed some text with graffiti murals
* Fixed a bug making it easier than intended to persuade people to meet with you for recruitment

* Added firearms to combat training
* Fixed crash on some news movies
* Fixed crash on crowbaring doors

## 1.1.0 - 4/15/2024
* Large experimental balance and thematic change to killing people on site missions: Killing anyone in a regular site action alienates everyone and turns the action into a rampage. Rampages still have a positive impact on the issues they affect. Rampages have a negative impact on public opinion of the LCS. Public opinion on the LCS has a significant impact on your effectiveness. Killing unimportant people gives no juice. Killing very important people gives extra juice.

* Added arrow key support to the Liberal Agenda screen
* Fixed the Hospital only healing people to 100 health, instead of 100% health
* Shortened the text for "Streaming for the Liberal Guardian" and "Writing for the Liberal Guardian" so they're less likely to overflow into other things (like your money, when the whole squad is doing it)
* Removed the words "like this" from the issue description for the AM Radio issue when you're taking over the studio, since it's shared by both the AM Radio and Cable News studios
* Fixed a math error that caused a negative number to appear when displaying how many people you're already dating when you fail to recruit someone with seduction

* Fixed bank employees failing to open the bank vault when threatened
* Removed some redundant indication of how big a stack of cash was
* Fixed squad members doing multiple things in one day when doing site visits
* Fixed lcs not becoming known through high profile site actions
* Fixed a miscalculation causing a massive backlash against the lcs for various actions that shouldn't cause a backlash
* Fixed an infinite loop if too many enemies show up for a car chase
* Fixed an overdrawing issue when threatening the landlord
* Fixed liberals not leaving their squad properly when going to the hospital

* Changed reference to "alternative newspaper" liberal guardian to "alternative news site"
* Fixed rampage news stories appearing on doing things you shouldn't have a news story about at all
* Fixed phasing into alarmed doors while examining them
* Fixed CCS not claiming their safehouses in We Didn't Start The Fire Mode (this fix will be retroactively applied when loading older saves)
* Fixed CCS boss encounter tiles spawning a CCS leader even if the CCS doesn't control the location

## 1.0.4 - 3/23/2024
* Fixed some empty space that can appear incorrectly in low priority news stories and filler text
* Fixed "ripped off" and "sht" being able to appear at the same time on a limb that was shot off
* Made it so if you take someone out of a squad, it also removes any clones of them, which should mitigate the occasional still-unsolved cloning bug

## 1.0.3 - 3/22/2024
* Nerfed the impact of particularly high strength with melee weapons, so instead of a soft cap on your damage multiplier and armor pen when you have very high strength, it's hard capped; this means, for example, you should no longer be routinely stabbing through body armor with a knife just because you have high strength
* Fixed a crash on hijacking the AM Radio or Cable News studios
* Fixed a crash on turning drug laws L+

## 1.0.2 - 3/20/2024
* Fixed Knife skill not using your Martial Arts skill due to a bug in the XML parsing
* Fixed loot not being sellable and being treated as 'damaged' instead
* Pre-emptively dimmed items when selling selectively if you aren't allowed to sell them, rather than giving you a message (which may be incorrect) about why you aren't allowed to sell them
* Fixed police/security checkpoints having zero standards and not turning their metal detectors on
* Fixed the invisible flag bug
* Fixed crash when wearing police body armor and carrying a gun
* Fixed bank manager filling in for the bank teller and screwing up your basic bank robberies
* Fixed phantom siege when you're not under siege but still have the under attack flag
* Updated backup save file format to not embed the inner json in a string, but to just actually have it all be in json format (older saves will still be imported correctly)
* Fixed the founder ignoring your initial codename selection at game start
* Fixed several bugs with masks
* Fixed people perpetually needing to go to the hospital but never actually hauling themselves there if they have broken bones but are otherwise at full health

* Made it so you don't need someone assigned to write or stream for the guardian at end of month to get the special edition prompt
* Made sneak attacks 4x more likely to hit a weak spot part (head) and never hit non-lethal areas (unless, of course, they hit armor)
* Updated error handling and extensively tested to try to maximize the value of future crash reports
* Homeless camp update: Police raiding the homeless camp attack immediately, they never siege. Unique raid announcement text, headlines, and other flavor text for raids on the homeless camp. If you resist, you never face SWAT teams, only regular cops, gang units, or death squads. If you resist, some of the others in the homeless camp will riot with you and fight the cops. If the police take the homeless camp, it gets ransacked, dismantled, and immediately reinitialized (like a location that re-opens after being closed down). The homeless camp is now marked as "LCS Temp Shelter" instead of "LCS Safehouse".

## 1.0.1 - 3/18/2024
* Fixed not being able to view a Liberal's full character sheet in site mode.
* Fixed loot spawning in apartment hallways.
* Fixed the option to accept rental terms not appearing if you can afford it.
* Fixed renting an apartment setting the rent on the property, but not giving you the keys, causing the landlord to just repeatedly hustle the squad for the first month's rent.
* Made squads take the apartments as their base immediately if you start renting there.
* Allowed you to continue running around in the apartment building after renting a room if you want to.
* Re-enabled raiding your own site if you really order your squad to, but it still won't prompt for trouble at other safehouses it unless it's an apartment. Apartments should behave like they do in the base game.
* Fixed a save/load issue that would cause two versions of every site to appear after game load, one for the menu to select locations and one for everything else; this could cause safehouses to not be marked on the map. 1.0.0 saves will throw out one of these two versions and keep the other; you may need to re-rent apartments if you were residing in them.
* Increased the strength of AM Radio and Cable News.
* Reduced the amount of random opinion drift over time.
* Made Congress take their own opinions much more seriously relative to the public's preferences when deciding which legislation to vote on, especially for extremist members.
* Took into account net pressure to change the law (in a given direction), not the total pressure (in any direction), when deciding whether Congress votes on a proposed law change.
* Made it so C+ only needs a simple majority to propose to repeal the constitution, disregards public opinion entirely when deciding to do so, requires all laws to already be C+ before they will do it, and can only propose to repeal the Constitution once every six months.
* Fixed the bank using a flimsy wooden door (unlocked) in front of the bank vault, instead of an impenetrable triple-locked metal vault door.
* Fixed the bank treating the entire building as the front lobby and not having any secure areas at all, to the point that random bank patrons could be seen milling around in the bank vault.
* Fixed rendering of partial skill points to take into account the escalating cost of reaching higher levels.
* Fixed the police station not really caring what anyone wears in the back rooms.
* Fixed a minor text overwriting issue when surrendering to police in sitemode.
* Fixed a crash on interacting with dogs and genetic monsters.
* Fixed naked enemies dropping a "Naked" item when killed.
* Flagged the build to include source maps so that the crash report stack traces should, hopefully, be actually useful.

## 1.0.0 - 3/17/2024
* Initial release of LCS: New Age beta, a web port of Liberal Crime Squad based on a blend of code from the forks maintained by IsaacG and SlatersQuest.
